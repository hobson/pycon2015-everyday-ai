* identify the "value" of patents based on their text alone
  - difficult to provide labeled data (troll financial news reports)? startup valuations?

* heat map of word "flow"
  - atmospheric "pressure" replaced by twitter or IRC word/concept frequency

  - information/word/concept "flow" could be computed as the gradient (del) of the "pressures"
  - animate over time
  - animate an instant in time with a wind plot like http://earth.nullschool.net/ and FOSS lib https://github.com/cambecc/earth
